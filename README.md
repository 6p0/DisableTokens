**If your token is found here, DON'T WORRY!** It's been automatically regenerated by Discord. But, that doesn't prevent your new token from being leaked again. MAKE SURE to always keep your token inside the .env file and make sure it is not public.

Tokens here have been found by me using scripts, or just when I randomly come across some. I never have the intention to abuse the tokens I find and will always reset them using this repo. I will not share how I find these tokens to prevent my methods being used for malicious purposes.

To contact me, please join this discord server (https://discord.gg/QyFPNGueNf) or you can open an issue.
